    <p>Full credit goes to Isa Chandra Moskowitz for discovering that dill plus poultry seasoning plus fake chicken broth makes a truly amazing soup base. Her stew, on p. 112 of "Fake Meat", quickly gained a place in my regular rotation. It's incredible that such a complex flavor can be made from just a few simple ingredients!</p>
<p>However, that recipe has four minor issues which keep it from being the platonic ideal of dill chicken stew:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are no potatoes, and I think it's hard to call something a stew without potatoes</li>
<li>The onions tend to get overcooked and a bit mushy with how long the stew has to simmer.</li>
<li>Parboiled rice is the clear winner for a stew like this because not only is it more nutritious, but it also cooks faster, keeping the veggies from overcooking and allowing you to eat sooner!</li>
<li>The recipe vs the ingredient list disagree about how much salt to use. 1 tsp feels like a bit much!</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is my slightly modified version of the recipe which tries to address three issues and create one of the tastiest, heartiest vegan stews ever.</p>
<h2>Yield: 4-5 Servings</h2>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>0.5-1 lb fake chicken of choice.<ul>
<li>I prefer Tofurkey Plant-Based Chick'n, but there are lots of options available, and just about any (non breaded) kind should work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Olive oil (for frying, at least 1 tbsp)</li>
<li>Vegan butter (for frying, at least 2 tbsp)</li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced into half moons</li>
<li>2 large carrots, peeled and cut into approx ~1/2 inch (12 mm) cubic chunks</li>
<li>3 small-med or 2 large ribs of celery, thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tsp poultry seasoning</li>
<li>A few grinds of black pepper</li>
<li>Salt (at least 1/4 tsp, plus some pinches)</li>
<li>3/4 cup parboiled (converted) rice.<ul>
<li>Parboiled (AKA converted) rice is commonly used in Cajun and Indian cuisines, and you may be able to find it at a health food market or Indian market. Here in California, WinCo Foods is the place to go!</li>
<li>It can also be ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zatarains-Long-Grain-Parboiled-White/dp/B00JPAV4QK/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1Im9fT1EpV9pTV-Q2rZolz6mJv5Au9j-g_AOynzgoGWY2OtprkjIt2YZZRdBw9qwY8XW9bZY_iUemW_O3bu6KzNp3JbxVrWikKOHmnmzgoUri76Kl7lK5JSocR2YMdHkbcj1EgKvZpD-8Gou3Z3wRMTLJ9J-aIugRxCqJt17ne2jtwUSB3SAt6H2kef_Hw6sMB9zHcbVaUakHUqgXWxH-ef_nQee5cB_U9OVeuXTqTc1BgwJ-qFCskWIbq3_A4cXdzThkpUGwyjXZxMvVwLniicdrZXEV_cQqSByBIGhh34.aPVYHXJZ7l6P23Cja4AhGnTwXeKz3J71id1BgbJg7Vc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=parboiled%2Brice&amp;qid=1744588065&amp;rdc=1&amp;sr=8-8&amp;th=1">online</a>.</li>
<li>You can also use white rice, but you will need to simmer the stew for longer!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>0.75-1 lb potatoes, red or gold preferred, chopped into chunks, skin left on</li>
<li>8 cups (~2 L) water plus 8 tsp <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillon-Chicken-Certified/dp/B000N7YKQK">fake chicken bouillon</a>. <ul>
<li>Equivalent to 8 cups fake chicken broth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, plus extra for garnish<ul>
<li>Measure this out by chopping it, then packing into a 1/4 cup measure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the ingredients: chop up the onions, celery, and carrots into one prep bowl, the garlic into another bowl, and the potatoes into a third bowl. Meanwhile, preheat a large (~4 quart) pot over medium heat.</li>
<li>Chop or tear the fake chicken into pieces, then saute it in the olive oil with a pinch of salt until nicely browned. Mix up the chicken every 2-3 min to get a different side browning. It should take about 10-15 min.</li>
<li>Remove chicken from the pot and set aside. Now, add 2 tbsp of fake butter, a pinch of salt, and then the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for about 5 min, until the onion is just translucent (but not all the way cooked).</li>
<li>Make a clear spot in the pan, then add in a little more butter/oil and the garlic in the clear spot. Let the garlic cook for 30-60 sec, until fragrant.</li>
<li>Add the poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt, and a few grinds of black pepper, then saute for another minute.</li>
<li>Add the rice, potatoes, water, and chicken bouillon.</li>
<li>Cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer.</li>
<li>Simmer until the potatoes are tender and the rice is done. I would recommend checking after about 15 min of simmering, but it might need an extra 5-10 min.</li>
<li>Stir in the fake chicken and chopped dill. Then, taste for seasoning. You might need an additional 1/4 or 1/2 tsp of salt depending on how salty your chicken broth is and how much salt you like.</li>
<li>It might taste better if you let it sit for a bit, but you can also serve right away!</li>
<li>Serve, garnishing with any extra dill. Some sourdough bread on the side might be a nice addition.  </li>
