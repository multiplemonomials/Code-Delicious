Full credit goes to Isa Chandra Moskowitz for discovering that dill plus poultry seasoning plus fake chicken broth makes a truly amazing soup base. Her stew, on p. 112 of "Fake Meat", quickly gained a place in my regular rotation. It's incredible that such a complex flavor can be made from just a few simple ingredients!

However, that recipe has four minor issues which keep it from being the platonic ideal of dill chicken stew:

1. There are no potatoes, and I think it's hard to call something a stew without potatoes
2. The onions tend to get overcooked and a bit mushy with how long the stew has to simmer.
3. Parboiled rice is the clear winner for a stew like this because not only is it more nutritious, but it also cooks faster, keeping the veggies from overcooking and allowing you to eat sooner!
4. The recipe vs the ingredient list disagree about how much salt to use. 1 tsp feels like a bit much!

Below is my slightly modified version of the recipe which tries to address three issues and create one of the tastiest, heartiest vegan stews ever.

## Yield: 4-5 Servings

## Ingredients:

- 0.5-1 lb fake chicken of choice.
    - I prefer Tofurkey Plant-Based Chick'n, but there are lots of options available, and just about any (non breaded) kind should work.
- Olive oil (for frying, at least 1 tbsp)
- Vegan butter (for frying, at least 2 tbsp)
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced into half moons
- 2 large carrots, peeled and cut into approx ~1/2 inch (12 mm) cubic chunks
- 3 small-med or 2 large ribs of celery, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp poultry seasoning
- A few grinds of black pepper
- Salt (at least 1/4 tsp, plus some pinches)
- 3/4 cup parboiled (converted) rice.
    - Parboiled (AKA converted) rice is commonly used in Cajun and Indian cuisines, and you may be able to find it at a health food market or Indian market. Here in California, WinCo Foods is the place to go!

    - You can also use white rice, but you will need to simmer the stew for longer!
- 0.75-1 lb potatoes, red or gold preferred, chopped into chunks, skin left on
- 8 cups (~2 L) water plus 8 tsp [fake chicken bouillon](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillon-Chicken-Certified/dp/B000N7YKQK). 
    - Equivalent to 8 cups fake chicken broth.
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, plus extra for garnish
    - Measure this out by chopping it, then packing into a 1/4 cup measure

## Directions:
1. Prepare the ingredients: chop up the onions, celery, and carrots into one prep bowl, the garlic into another bowl, and the potatoes into a third bowl. Meanwhile, preheat a large (~4 quart) pot over medium heat.
2. Chop or tear the fake chicken into pieces, then saute it in the olive oil with a pinch of salt until nicely browned. Mix up the chicken every 2-3 min to get a different side browning. It should take about 10-15 min.
3. Remove chicken from the pot and set aside. Now, add 2 tbsp of fake butter, a pinch of salt, and then the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for about 5 min, until the onion is just translucent (but not all the way cooked).
4. Make a clear spot in the pan, then add in a little more butter/oil and the garlic in the clear spot. Let the garlic cook for 30-60 sec, until fragrant.
5. Add the poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt, and a few grinds of black pepper, then saute for another minute.
6. Add the rice, potatoes, water, and chicken bouillon.
7. Cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer.
8. Simmer until the potatoes are tender and the rice is done. I would recommend checking after about 15 min of simmering, but it might need an extra 5-10 min.
9. Stir in the fake chicken and chopped dill. Then, taste for seasoning. You might need an additional 1/4 or 1/2 tsp of salt depending on how salty your chicken broth is and how much salt you like.
10. It might taste better if you let it sit for a bit, but you can also serve right away!
11. Serve, garnishing with any extra dill. Some sourdough bread on the side might be a nice addition.
